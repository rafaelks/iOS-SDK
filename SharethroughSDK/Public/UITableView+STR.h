/** 
 Sharethrough-aware alternatives to UITableView's methods for adding/moving/deleting/accessing content. Using these methods allows users to use indexPaths based on their content without having to know where any of the ads are. The indexPaths passed into/returned out of these methods will all be representative of a UITableView that does not have ads. For methods that affect row count/sections (e.g. -insertRowsAtIndexPaths:) it is required that these alternate methods are called otherwise the SDK will incorrectly render both ads and your content.
 
 These methods will raise exception unless tableview has been set up with -[SharethroughSDK placeAdInTableView:adCellReuseIdentifier:placementKey:presentingViewController:adHeight:adInitialIndexPath:]
