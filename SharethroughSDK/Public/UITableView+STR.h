/** 
 Sharethrough-aware alternatives to UITableView's methods for adding/moving/deleting/accessing content. These methods are ad-aware-- they will adjust the index paths that the built in UITableView's methods use so that ad rows aren't adversely affected. Switching to use these methods will mean that users will not have to translate their own index paths before making changes to the UITableView. For methods that affect row count/sections (e.g. -insertRowsAtIndexPaths:) it is required that these alternate methods are called otherwise the SDK will incorrectly render both ads and your content.
 
 These methods will raise exception unless tableview has been set up with -[SharethroughSDK placeAdInTableView:adCellReuseIdentifier:placementKey:presentingViewController:adHeight:]
