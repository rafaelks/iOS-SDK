 If your app is using a basic UITableView that you want to present ads within, you may alternately use the following method to insert an ad.

This reuse identifier should be separate from the reuse identifier used for your content cells, even if they are registered with the same class or xib.

Calling this method on the same table view will remove previously existing ad(s) and place an ad at the place specified by adStartingIndexPath.

 @param adCellReuseIdentifier The reuse identifier to use whenever displaying an ad cell; the reuse identifier must be registered with the table view with a cell that conforms to the STRAdView protocol

 @param presentingViewController The view controller that will present the interactive ad controller if the user taps on the ad
 @param adHeight The height of the adCell. This value will be unused if your delegate does not implement -tableView:heightForRowAtIndexPath: (the tableView will use rowHeight instead)
 @param adInitialIndexPath The inital index path to place the ad in. This index path should represent where the ad is, including the ad within the table view. This means that if you have 3 rows in a section, an index path of row 3 would in fact be valid. Index paths that are out of bounds will raise an exception. This should be the only index path computed with concern for there being an ad in the table view. Pass nil to let the SharethroughSDK choose a default location.
