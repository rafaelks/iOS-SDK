Sharethrough provides this Software Developer Kit, which includes, without limitation, several components (the “Components”), APIs, associated documentation (the “Associated Documentation”), code and API usage examples, and any error corrections, updates or new releases thereto, all of which may include object code and source code, as provided by Sharethrough (collectively, the “SDK”) for the intended purpose of allowing publishers and developers (also referred to as “You” and “Your”) to integrate into and utilize the SDK with Your applications in order to better integrate and configure native advertisements in Your applications (“Your Products”). 
There may be additional terms and conditions applicable to certain Components of the SDK, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. You agree to abide by such other terms and conditions. To the extent that a conflict exists between the terms provided below and those posted for or applicable to certain Components of the SDK, the latter are controlling.

1. Intellectual Property Rights.
a. You understand and agree that Sharethrough and its licensors own and retain all right, title and interest in and to the SDK and all Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) therein (collectively, the “Sharethrough Property”).

For purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means any patent rights, copyrights, trade secrets, trade names, service marks, moral rights, know-how and any other similar rights or intangible assets recognized under any laws or international conventions, and in any country or jurisdiction in the world, as intellectual creations to which rights of ownership accrue, and all registrations, applications, disclosures, renewals, extensions, continuations or reissues of the foregoing now or hereafter in force.
